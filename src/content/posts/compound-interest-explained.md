Albert Einstein reportedly called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world. Whether or not he said it, the math behind compounding is genuinely powerful.

## How It Works

Simple interest earns returns only on your principal. Compound interest earns returns on your returns. A $10,000 investment at 8% annual return becomes $21,589 in 10 years with compounding, compared to $18,000 with simple interest.

## The Rule of 72

Divide 72 by your annual return rate to estimate how many years it takes to double your money. At 8%, your money doubles roughly every 9 years. At 10%, every 7.2 years.

## Time Is Everything

Starting early is more important than investing large amounts later. Someone who invests $200/month starting at age 25 will have more at 65 than someone who invests $400/month starting at 35, assuming the same returns.

## Compounding Frequency

Interest can compound annually, quarterly, monthly, or daily. More frequent compounding produces slightly higher returns. The difference between annual and monthly compounding on a $10,000 investment at 8% over 10 years is about $180.
