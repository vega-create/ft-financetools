Return on Investment (ROI) is the most fundamental measure of investment performance. Every investor should understand how to calculate and interpret it.

## Basic ROI Formula

ROI = (Current Value - Cost) / Cost × 100. If you bought stock for $10,000 and it is now worth $13,000, your ROI is 30%. Simple and intuitive.

## Annualized Returns

ROI does not account for time. A 30% return in 1 year is very different from 30% over 10 years. Annualized return uses the formula: (1 + ROI)^(1/years) - 1. Use our Investment Return Calculator for instant results.

## Real vs Nominal Returns

Nominal returns do not account for inflation. If your investment returned 8% but inflation was 3%, your real return was about 5%. Always consider inflation when evaluating long-term performance.

## Comparing Investments

Use annualized ROI to compare investments with different time horizons. Also consider risk: a 10% return from bonds is more impressive than 10% from volatile stocks because bonds carry less risk.

## Common Pitfalls

Do not ignore fees and taxes when calculating returns. A fund returning 8% with 1% annual fees effectively returns 7%. Capital gains taxes further reduce your actual returns.
