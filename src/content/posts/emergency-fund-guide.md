An emergency fund is the foundation of financial security. Without one, a single unexpected expense can derail your finances.

## How Much to Save

The standard advice is 3-6 months of essential expenses. If you have a stable job and multiple income sources, 3 months may suffice. If you are self-employed or have variable income, aim for 6-12 months.

## What Counts as Expenses

Calculate your monthly essentials: rent or mortgage, utilities, groceries, insurance, minimum debt payments, and transportation. Do not include discretionary spending. Use our Savings Goal Planner to set a realistic target.

## Where to Keep It

Keep your emergency fund in a high-yield savings account. It needs to be accessible within 1-2 business days but separate from your checking account to avoid temptation. Current high-yield savings rates are around 4-5%.

## Building Your Fund

Start with a goal of $1,000 for immediate emergencies. Then work toward one month of expenses, then three, then six. Automate monthly transfers to make saving effortless.

## When to Use It

An emergency fund is for genuine emergencies: job loss, medical bills, urgent car or home repairs. It is not for sales, vacations, or planned expenses. After using it, prioritize rebuilding it.
