Most people leave money on the table by not negotiating their salary. Understanding your numbers gives you confidence and leverage.

## Know Your Market Rate

Research salaries for your role, experience level, and location using sites like Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Use our Salary Calculator to convert between hourly, monthly, and annual figures for accurate comparison.

## Calculate Your Total Compensation

Salary is just one component. Factor in bonuses, stock options, retirement matching, health insurance, and other benefits. A $90,000 salary with $10,000 in benefits equals $100,000 total compensation.

## The Cost of Not Negotiating

A $5,000 increase in starting salary, invested at 8% over a 30-year career, grows to over $500,000. Each raise builds on previous ones, making early negotiation especially valuable.

## Negotiation Strategies

Lead with your value, not your needs. Present specific accomplishments and their business impact. Give a range with your target at the bottom. Practice your pitch until it feels natural.

## When to Negotiate

Negotiate when you receive an offer, during annual reviews, after completing a major project, or when taking on significantly more responsibility. Use our Tax Estimator to understand how a raise affects your take-home pay.
